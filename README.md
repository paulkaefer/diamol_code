## Paul's **DIAMOL** repo

Tracks my code and [notes](/notes.md) working through the book **Learn Docker in a Month of Lunches**. [O'Reilly link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learn-docker-in/9781617297052/).

See [the official book repo](https://github.com/sixeyed/diamol.git) for resources (the [supplemental content](https://www.manning.com/downloads/2057) seems to be a snapshot from Feb 2020).
